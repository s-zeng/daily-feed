# [2025-10-03] Recap: Reading Time Estimation - Task 1

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-10-03-reading-time-estimation/spec.md.

## Recap

Completed Task 1 of the reading time estimation feature, establishing the foundational data structures for tracking reading times. This task adds the necessary fields to the AST and configuration that will be used in subsequent tasks to calculate and display reading times.

**What was completed:**
- Added `reading_time_minutes: Option<u32>` field to `Article` struct in src/ast.rs
- Added `total_reading_time_minutes: Option<u32>` field to `Feed` struct in src/ast.rs
- Added `total_reading_time_minutes: Option<u32>` field to `Document` struct in src/ast.rs
- Added `reading_speed_wpm: Option<u32>` field to `Config` struct with validation (50-500 WPM range, defaults to 200 WPM)
- Created comprehensive tests for AST field serialization/deserialization
- Created validation tests for reading speed configuration boundaries
- Updated all test fixtures and snapshots to include new fields
- Added config.example.json as reference configuration
- All 120+ tests passing

## Context

Implement reading time estimation that calculates and displays how long each article, feed, and the full document will take to read. Users can optionally configure their reading speed in words per minute (default: 200 WPM), and estimates are displayed in article metadata, table of contents, and as aggregated totals.

This is Task 1 of 6 total tasks. Remaining tasks will implement the calculation logic, parser integration, and display in EPUB and Markdown outputs.

## Files Modified

- `/Users/simonzeng/repos/daily-feed/src/ast.rs` - Added reading time fields to Article, Feed, and Document structs
- `/Users/simonzeng/repos/daily-feed/src/config.rs` - Added reading_speed_wpm configuration field with validation
- `/Users/simonzeng/repos/daily-feed/config.example.json` - Added example reading speed configuration
- Multiple test snapshots updated to reflect new optional fields

## Next Steps

The following tasks remain for the reading time estimation feature:
- Task 2: Implement word counting logic
- Task 3: Add reading time calculation in parser
- Task 4: Display reading times in EPUB output
- Task 5: Display reading times in Markdown output
- Task 6: Add integration tests
