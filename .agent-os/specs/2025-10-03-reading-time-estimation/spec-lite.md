# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement reading time estimation that calculates and displays how long each article, feed, and the full document will take to read. Users can optionally configure their reading speed in words per minute (default: 200 WPM), and estimates are displayed in article metadata, table of contents, and as aggregated totals.
