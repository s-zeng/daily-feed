- [ ] Multi-model support expansion - Add support for additional LLM providers (OpenAI, local models) `M`
- [ ] Summary caching - Cache AI-generated summaries to reduce API costs on repeated runs `S`

### Dependencies

- Existing AI client infrastructure (`ai_client.rs`, `front_page.rs`)
- LLM provider APIs (Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
