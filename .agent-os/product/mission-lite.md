# Product Mission (Lite)

daily-feed is a Rust CLI application that helps information-conscious readers escape endless scrolling by providing a curated, once-a-day newsfeed delivered directly to their e-reader.

daily-feed serves intentional readers who want focused content consumption without algorithmic distractions. Unlike typical RSS readers, daily-feed uses a compiler-style AST architecture to transform feeds into properly formatted EPUB/Markdown files, enhanced with AI-generated summaries and specialized integrations like Ars Technica comment extraction.
