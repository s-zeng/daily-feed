# Front Page Design Guidelines

*Documentation written by Claude Code*

## Purpose

The front page serves as an executive summary of the daily news feed, providing readers with a quick overview of the current state of the world without requiring them to read through all articles.

## Key Elements of an Effective Front Page

### 1. Top Stories Section
- **Breaking News**: Immediate, high-impact events that just occurred
- **Major Developments**: Significant ongoing stories with new developments
- **Limit**: 3-5 top stories maximum to maintain focus

### 2. World at a Glance
- **Geographic Coverage**: Balance between local, national, and international news
- **Sector Coverage**: Politics, economics, technology, health, environment, social issues
- **Trend Identification**: Emerging patterns across multiple stories

### 3. Controversy & Debate Highlights
- **Polarizing Issues**: Stories generating significant public discourse
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Brief mention of different viewpoints when relevant
- **Context**: Why these issues matter and their potential impact

### 4. Signal vs Noise Filtering
- **Importance Criteria**:
  - Affects large numbers of people
  - Has long-term implications
  - Represents significant change or trend
  - Generates substantial public interest
- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Celebrity gossip (unless politically/economically relevant)
  - Minor local incidents without broader implications
  - Repetitive updates without new information

### 5. Structure and Flow
- **Lead Paragraph**: Single sentence capturing the day's most significant theme
- **Story Summaries**: 1-2 sentences per story maximum
- **Categorization**: Group related stories when applicable
- **Forward-Looking**: Mention upcoming events or expected developments

### 6. Tone and Style
- **Neutral**: Avoid editorial commentary while acknowledging controversy
- **Concise**: Maximum 300-400 words total
- **Accessible**: Clear language that doesn't require domain expertise
- **Urgent**: Convey the importance and timeliness of information

## Quality Indicators

A good front page should:
- Enable someone to understand the day's significance in under 2 minutes
- Identify the most important stories even if they disagree with the selection
- Provide enough context to understand why stories matter
- Balance comprehensiveness with brevity
- Reflect the actual importance of events, not just their media coverage

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Recency Bias**: Prioritizing latest news over most important news
- **Volume Confusion**: Mistaking number of articles for story importance
- **Missing Connections**: Failing to link related stories or themes
- **False Balance**: Giving equal weight to stories of unequal importance
- **Jargon Overload**: Using technical terms without explanation
